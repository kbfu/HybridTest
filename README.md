# HybridTest
> Integrated with MBT, TDD and BDD. Thanks to Robot Framework for the generic test framework. MBT inspired by GraphWalker.

> Add my own parallel script to run robot test suites in parallel mode. Doesn't like pabot, it will run each test case in parallel.

> Run 'python model_walker.py --help' and 'python parallel_run.py --help' to check out the help.
